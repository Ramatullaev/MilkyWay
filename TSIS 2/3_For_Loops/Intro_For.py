# Python For Loops
'''With the for loop we can execute a set of statements,
once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.'''

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

# Looping Through a String
# Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:
for x in "banana":
  print(x)
