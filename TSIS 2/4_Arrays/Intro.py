# Arrays
# Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]


# Get the value of the first array item:
x = cars[0]

# Modify the value of the first array item:
cars[0] = "Toyota"


'''Use the len() method to return the length of an 
array (the number of elements in an array).'''
x = len(cars)

# Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.
